# CENG 401: Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence

Welcome to the course materials for CENG 401, taught by Dr. Rayan Abri. This folder contains practical Python projects, datasets, and code examples covering key topics in machine learning and artificial intelligence. You will use these resources for hands-on learning, assignments, and demonstrations throughout the semester.

## What You'll Find Here

- **Data Preprocessing:** Scripts and examples for cleaning, transforming, and preparing real-world datasets.
- **Supervised Learning:** Step-by-step projects for algorithms such as KNN, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Naive Bayes, and Neural Networks.
- **Model Evaluation:** Code for splitting datasets, evaluating models, and interpreting classification reports.
- **Visualization:** Examples of data visualization, feature importance, and model structure.
- **README Files:** Each subfolder contains a detailed README explaining the workflow, code, and concepts for that topic.

## How to Use This Folder

1. **Read the README in each subfolder** before running code. It explains the steps, requirements, and learning objectives.
2. **Run the scripts in order** as described in each README. Most projects use real datasets and standard Python libraries.
3. **Experiment and modify the code** to deepen your understanding. Try changing parameters, adding features, or testing new algorithms.
4. **Ask questions and share your results** in class or on the course platform.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Common libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, torch, torchvision
- Internet connection (for downloading datasets)

## About the Instructor
